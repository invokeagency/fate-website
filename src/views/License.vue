        <p>You may access Fate Subliminals Premium by purchasing a subscription within the App, where allowed by the App marketplace partners.

Your credit card issuer may give you the right to opt-out of the update service. Should you desire to do so, please contact your credit card issuer.</p>

        <h2>MEDICAL DISCLAIMER</h2>
        <p>We are not a health care or medical device provider, nor should our Products be considered medical advice. Only your physician or other health care provider can do that.

In particular, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we make no representation or warranties about the accuracy, completeness, or suitability for any purpose of the advice, other materials and information published as part of the Products.</p>

        <p>There have been rare reports where people with certain psychiatric problems like anxiety and depression have experienced worsening conditions in conjunction with intensive listening practice. People with existing mental health conditions should speak with their health care providers before starting a meditation practice.</p>
